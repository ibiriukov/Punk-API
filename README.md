# Punk-API
Instructions:
API Testing exercise
Most of us at Kasa are loving good and quality beers and we would like to find out which one has a special yeast and hops combination using this public API.
Create a couple of examples using your own preferred tool or solution (in a scripted way) in order to tell us which beer has 'Wyeast 3522 - Belgian Ardennes' 
yeast in it with 'Tomahawk' hops.
Create a test that checks if the selected beer has exactly 12.5 grams of 'Magnum' hops and fails if the creator puts other amounts in it. 
Please also check if the IBU content is entered as a number and if the description for the beer is not empty.
